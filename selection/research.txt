All the things found about FINE model is written here for tracking

** I've tried to review all the helper functions first to have a better idea when we look at 
the main function 

- fit_mixture function in gmm.py file

	+ takes in scores, labels and p_threshold
	+ scores is presumbaly an array that has predicted scores for the corresponding labels
	+ somethings happen here, and then using the p_threshold as a bare minimum
	+ clean labels are returned to wherever the function was called

	# TODO: 

		! try printing everything in this function to have a better understanding of what is happening 

- get_mean_vector function in svd_classifier.py

	+ takes in features and labels 
	+ literally returned a mean_vector_dict

	# TODO: 
		
		! try printing one or two confusing things to get a better understanding

- get_singular_vector function in svd_classifier.py

	+ gets a top1 singular vector in class-wise manner by using SVD ok hidden feature vectors
	+ features: hidden feature vectors of data (numpy)
	+ labels: corresponding label list

- get_score function in svd_classifier.py

	+ takes in singular_vector_dict, featues, labels and normalization bool
	+ calculates the score providing the degree of showing whether the data is clean or not 

- extract_topk function in svd_classifier.py

	+ k: ration to extract topk scores in class-wise manner
	+ to obtain the most promising clean data in each classes
	+ return selected labels

- cleanising function in svd_classifier.py

	+ it assumes the distribution of scores is bimodal spherical distribution
	+ returns clean labels that belongs to the clean cluster made by the kMeans algorithm
	+ takes in scores and labels and returns an array of clean labels

- fine function (MAIN ONE)

	+ takes in current features, current_labels, fit
	+ an could pass additional args such as: prev_features, prev_labels, p_threshold, norm, eigen

	+ legit returns clean labels
	+ if you don't pass the previous rounds, then the data is split just based on what we have
	+ it's not too hard to understand this one 


- extract_cleanidx (MAIN ONE used by FINE model)

	+ takes in teacher, data_loader, parse
	+ calls the fine function and then returns the clean labels
	+ fill like this one is just to print out the things returned by the fine function 

	# TODO:
		
		! would be good to have this one working to get more statistics on how the values are printed and stuff

--> SOUNDS GOOD SO FAR, NO NEXT GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THIS TO GET CLEAN LABELS FOR PES
