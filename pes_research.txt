--> Research about integrating FINE function into PES

- update_train function in PES_semi.py file 

	+ takes in model, data, clean_labels, noisy_labels
	+ returns labeled_trainloader, unlabeled_trainloader, class_weights


	(&) some extraneous points

	: they are doing a softmax prediction to get the values and then using that 
		output they are splitting the data into clean and noisy label idxs


- cleansing function in FINE implementation 

	+ it's calling some kmeans function from sklearn kit which is a bit confusing to look at, at first 
	+ 


==> Major Plan

- the plan now is to get the clean label indexes using FINE and pass it through PES's current framework to see if we get some more test accuracy 

- let's see how it goes (20th April)
